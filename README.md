# star-rating-prediction-of-retaurants
 Program aims to understand the star ratings of restaurants around Bahcesehir University through Yemeksepeti
Dataset Description
I created the dataset from the restaurants the deliver food to Bahcesehir University. The data includes restaurant names, star ratings, location, minimum amount of payment needed to order, the distance from the university to that restaurant and whether the restaurant is discounted, is a super restaurant and has vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options. The price per meter and the speed of the delivery were made by us to give further insight on the restaurants. 
Method
I used the regression method in this project. Regression is a statistical measure that allows us to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and independent variables. That is, it means fitting a function from a selected family of functions to the data sampled under some error function. Regression analysis is one of the most basic tools in machine learning used for prediction. Using regression, we fit a function to existing data and try to predict the outcome from future data.
The dependent variable (star rating) was dependent on other independent variables. That's why I decided that regression was the most appropriate machine learning method I could use.
